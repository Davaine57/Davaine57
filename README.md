Welcome to my landing page 

I have more projects that I have not shared publicly. Im currently focusing on working with larger and more complex datasets and performing data manipulation and subsequent visualization.

# Simple_linear_regression
This project is an example of how to use simple linear regression to describe the relationship between one dependatnt variable and one independant variable

# Installation
To complete this take please make sure that you have access to Python, Jupyter, Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib. I also used Scikit-Learn.

# Usage
To execute this project, the code must be entered into a Python script editor or Jupyter Notebook The code reads data from a comma seperated values file named "insurance.csv".

# Observation
The code in the images above outline that a linear relationship can be seen between the age of the customer and the amount they are charged for insurance. As can be seen via the blue plotted line.
